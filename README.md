# ReposCheck
A very simple utility to check if repos within `/Documents/GitHub` have any modified files.

# Setup
1. Add repos you want to track inside `/Documents/GitHub`.
2. Add the `repos-status.sh` script file to above directory.
3. Run command `chmod 777 git-status` in the directory to make this file executable.
4. Run the ReposCheck app.
